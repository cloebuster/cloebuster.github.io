    <p>These are their territories.</p>
    <p>African elephants (both species) live in the wild on much of the African continent south of the Sahara.</p>
    <p>Asian elephants live in the wild in India and Southeast Asia including Sumatra and Borneo.</p>

    <h2>What are elephants like?</h2>
    <div id="What_are_elephants_like_text">
    <p>Female elephants spend their entire lives living in large groups called herds. Male elephants leave their herds at about 13 years old and live fairly solitary lives, sometimes joining loose-knit “bachelor herds” of other male elephants, leaving at will to search for potential mates. A herd can consist of 8-100 individuals depending on terrain, climate, and family size. Female herds are led by “matriarchs” often the oldest and wisest female in the group.</p>
    <p>An elephant will usually have 1 calf (twins are very rare) and the mother and all of the other females in the herd, including aunts, grandmothers, and sisters, will raise the baby. Elephants gestate for 18 to 22 months, which is the longest gestation period of any mammal. An elephant in the wild will rarely have more than four children throughout her life.</p>

    <h2>What does an elephant eat?</h2>
    <div id="what_do_elephants_eat">
    <p>Elephants are herbivores: they eat a range of plants, including grasses, fruit, and roots. An adult elephant consumes about 100 kg (220 pounds) of food and 100 liters (26 gallons) of water per day. These amounts can be double for a hungry and thirsty individual. Such consumption makes elephants an important ecological factor, because it substantially affects and even alters the ecosystems elephants live in.</p>

    <h2>How smart are elephants?</h2>

    <div id="Smart_elephants_text">
    <p>Elephants are extremely intelligent animals and have memories that span many years. They are also highly sensitive and caring animals. If a baby elephant complains, the entire family will rumble and go over to touch and caress it. Elephants express grief, joy, compassion, self-awareness, altruism, and play. Elephants pay homage to the bones of their dead, gently touching the skulls and tusks with their trunks and feet. When an elephant walks past a place that a loved one has died, he/she will stop and pause for several minutes.</p>
    <p>Elephants are one of the few species that recognize themselves in a mirror. The others are humans, apes, orcas, dolphins, and most recently discovered- magpies.</p>

    <h2>Are there threats to elephants?</h2>

    <div id="threats_text"
    <p>Asian and African elephants are listed as endangered species. They are threatened by habitat loss and poaching done by humans. At the beginning of the 21st century, fewer than 50,000 Asian elephants remained in the wild. From 1979 to 1989 the number of African elephants in the wild was reduced by more than half, from 1,300,000 to 600,000, partly as a result of commercial demand for ivory.</p>
