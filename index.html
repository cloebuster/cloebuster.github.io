    <h3>What are elephants?</h3>
    <p>Elephants are the largest living land animals, characterized by their long trunk, columnar legs, ivory tusks, and huge head with wide flat ears.</p>
    <p>There are three species of elephants (from left to right).</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>African Savanna</li>
        <li>African Forest</li>
        <li>Asian</li>
      </ol>

    <br>
    <p>African elephants (both species) live in the wild on much of the African continent south of the Sahara.</p>
    <p>Asian elephants live in the wild in India and Southeast Asia including Sumatra and Borneo.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>What are elephants like?</h3>
    <p>Female elephants spend their entire lives living in large groups called herds. Male elephants leave their herds at about 13 years old and live fairly solitary lives, sometimes joining loose-knit “bachelor herds” of other male elephants, leaving at will to search for potential mates. A herd can consist of 8-100 individuals depending on terrain, climate, and family size. Female herds are led by “matriarchs” often the oldest and wisest female in the group.</p>
    <p>An elephant will usually have 1 calf (twins are very rare) and the mother and all of the other females in the herd, including aunts, grandmothers, and sisters, will raise the baby. Elephants gestate for 18 to 22 months, which is the longest gestation period of any mammal. An elephant in the wild will rarely have more than four children throughout her life.</p>

    <h3>What does an elephant eat?</h3>
    <p>Elephants are herbivores: they eat a range of plants, including grasses, fruit, and roots. An adult elephant consumes about 100 kg (220 pounds) of food and 100 liters (26 gallons) of water per day. These amounts can be double for a hungry and thirsty individual. Such consumption makes elephants an important ecological factor, because it substantially affects and even alters the ecosystems elephants live in.</p>

    <br>
    <h3>How smart are elephants?</h3>
    <p>Elephants have a highly developed brain and the largest of all the land mammals. Their brain is 3 or 4 times larger than that of humans although smaller as a proportion of body weight. Elephants are extremely intelligent animals and have memories that span many years. It is this memory that serves matriarchs well during dry seasons when they need to guide their herds, sometimes for tens of miles, to watering holes that they remember from the past.</p>
    <p>Elephants are highly sensitive and caring animals. If a baby elephant complains, the entire family will rumble and go over to touch and caress it. Elephants express grief, joy, compassion, self-awareness, altruism, and play. Elephants pay homage to the bones of their dead, gently touching the skulls and tusks with their trunks and feet. When an elephant walks past a place that a loved one has died, he/she will stop; a silent and empty pause that can last several minutes.</p>
    <p>Elephants are one of the few species that recognize themselves in a mirror. The others are humans, apes, orcas, dolphins, and most recently discovered- magpies.</p>

    <h3>Are there threats to elephants?</h3>
    <p>Asian and African elephants are listed as endangered species. They are threatened by habitat loss and poaching done by humans. At the beginning of the 21st century, fewer than 50,000 Asian elephants remained in the wild. From 1979 to 1989 the number of African elephants in the wild was reduced by more than half, from 1,300,000 to 600,000, partly as a result of commercial demand for ivory.</p>
